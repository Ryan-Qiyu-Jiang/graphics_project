Just a simple example of how pose estimation can be used to make computer graphics animations a bit easier.

Out of the box 3D human pose estimation from video is accurate enough now to make natural human animations. So instead of having to keyframe Suzanne for each dance, she can learn from lots of dance video tutorials online, with varying degrees of success...

It's exciting to think how awesome video games will be when we have more accurate real-time pose estimation!
